This is a simple and dumb client using the network library. It sets itself up
as a receiver for UDP messages and waits for anything to come in. A separate
goroutine polls for commandline input from the user. Depending on which
addresses you used to invoke it, you can use this to have the client talk to
itself over a UDP connection.

Example invocation:

	$ ./client [::1] [::1]:54321 [::1]:54321

or the ipv4 version:

	$ ./client 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1:54321 127.0.0.1:54321


The last 2 addresses with ports are the public source and destination.
The source is the address/port on which this client listens for incoming data.
The destination is just used for the sake of demonstration. Any text you type
in the console after launching the client, will be sent to that address/port.

So by specifying the same address/port twice, you essentially just send the
data back to this client itself. This is quite handy for debugging purposes as
the program is both the client and server at the same time.

The first address in the invocation (without the port number), should be the
internal LAN ip your system has. For the sake of testing we use the loopback
address for everything, but normally the first one would be different. It is
used to identify this client when it's behind a NAT router. We hope to fix the
library soon enough so this will be detected automatically, but for now you have
to specify it manually.

 EXAMPLE
================================================================================

Here is some sample output of the client program. The text following a '>' is
input into the console manually. Once the return key is hit, the network library
sends it to the receiver. Which in this case is the client itself. Basically
like a very dumb chat client.

Don't mind the utter randomness of the input text. I was bored :p

Fields as they are listed in the output below:

 - Subsequence numbers for fragmented packets. eg: packet 1 of 5
 - Packet flags: Compressed | Encrypted | Fragmented
 - Packet sequence number. Current number of total packets sent in session.
 - client id. 2 least significant bytes of local client IP (IP from LAN network
   if present. used to keep multiple clients behind NAT separated)
 - packet content

Packetsize is set to 45 bytes for this test. 22 bytes for UDP header, 7 bytes
for fragmented packet header and 16 bytes for actual data. This limit would
normally be 1400 bytes. Low size limit was needed to test packet fragmentation.
