This is a simple and dumb client using the network library. It sets itself up
as a receiver for UDP messages and waits for anything to come in. A separate
goroutine polls for commandline input from the user. This client simply talks
to itself using UDP messages through the supplied address/port.

Example invocation:

	$ ./client [::1]:54321

or the ipv4 version:

	$ ./client 127.0.0.1:54321


The address is the address/port on which this client listens for incoming data,
as well as the address we send our commandline input to.
